Main source lives in exec/Halive.hs


*N.B.:*

I couldn't make halive as a library due to a separate oddity with
ghc @rpaths suddently not resolving, but should you attempt it, 
be aware that executables based on halive 
must be built with the -dynamic flag for ghc or else strange errors 
may occur when interfacing with external libraries like CoreFoundation
(GHCi uses this flag for its executable as well).
